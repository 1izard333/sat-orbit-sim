# Haskell Satellite Planetary Orbital Simulation
By: Elizabeth Witney & Joy Lantz
***
## Project Overview

### Module Descriptions
Main
* Runs the program, initializes the GUI
Orbit
* Handles the simulation itself and processing images
Equations
* Contains all of the needed equations for the project
Sim
* Handles the user interactions through the console
Display
* Was being used for user interactions (buttons), now is no longer being used

## Work Assignments
Both members collaborated on the project and all work was split as evenly as possible. All work was communicated clearly, so even if a member did not write certain code they could still understand it. 

Liz - 
* Orbit
* Equations
* Main
* Display
Joy - 
* Display
* Main
* Planet Images
* Satellite Image

## Problems Encountered & Future Modifications
* Problems Encountered
  * We originally planned to have buttons to switch which planet was being selected and to increase/decrease the velocity, acceleration, and eccentricity. Unfortunately, we could not figure out how to combine the libraries being used and/or convert all work to a single library
  * We had to scrap all work being done in Display and create a new module for new user interactions

* Future Modifications
  * Add buttons to the GUI rather than having the user run things through the console
  * Have buttons for planets be the planet images
  * Possibly add other fun/unique/crazy options like having the satellite explode
